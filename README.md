# Call Center Report

## Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of an call center company in the US for the October, 2020. By analyzing various aspects of the call center data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of caller's needs and perception.

## Data Source
Call center: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Call Center Dataset" file [Download here](https://ko-fi.com/W7W81ZJLV)

## Tools Used
- Excel
    -  Ms Office 365

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Data sourcing and loading.
- Data inspection.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Created `call day` column.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the call center data to answer key questions, such as:

1. Total count of inbound calls?
2. Frequency of Call Channels?
3. Calls categorized by sentiments?
4. Calls categorized by requests?
5. To be able  to see data at the call center and call day level.

## Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- There was a total of 32941 inbound calls.
- Requests through direct calls to the center holds the highest percentage of inbound calls.
- Los Angeles/CA received the highest calls with majority of them having negative sentiments.
- Most response time was within the Service Level Agreement.
- Billings has the highest volume for call reasons.

## Limitations
I think it is essential to note that to achieve the filled map plot, MS office 365 has to be installed or the add-in is activated.

## Recommendation

- Promote alternative contact channels (i.e., email, chatbox, web) to reduce the burden on call centers.
- Balance call volumes by reallocating resources across call centers based on peak demand.
- Develop FAQs, tutorials, and proactive notifications addressing common billing issues to reduce inbound call volume.
